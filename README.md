## BinaryGap

A binary gap within a positive integer `N` is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of `N`.

For example, number `9` has binary representation `1001` and contains a binary gap of length `2`. The number `529` has binary representation `1000010001` and contains two binary gaps: one of length `4` and one of length `3`. The number `20` has binary representation `10100` and contains one binary gap of length `1`. The number `15` has binary representation `1111` and has no binary gaps. The number `32` has binary representation `100000` and has no binary gaps.

Write a function:

```
class BinaryGap { public int solution(int N); }
```

that, given a positive integer `N`, returns the length of its `longest` binary gap. The function should return `0` if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

For example, given `N = 1041` the function should return `5`, because N has binary representation `10000010001` and so its longest binary gap is of length `5`. Given `N = 32` the function should return `0`, because `N` has binary representation `100000` and thus no binary gaps.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].

## CyclicRotation

An array `A` consisting of `N` integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation of array `A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]` is `[6, 3, 8, 9, 7]` (elements are shifted right by one index and `6` is moved to the first place).

The goal is to rotate array `A` `K` times; that is, each element of `A` will be shifted to the right `K` times.

Write a function:

```
class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }
```

that, given an array `A` consisting of `N` integers and an integer `K`, returns the array `A` rotated `K` times.

For example, given

    A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
    K = 3
the function should return `[9, 7, 6, 3, 8]`. Three rotations were made:

    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
    [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
For another example, given

    A = [0, 0, 0]
    K = 1
the function should return `[0, 0, 0]`

Given

    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    K = 4
the function should return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

Assume that:

`N` and `K` are integers within the range `[0..100]`;
each element of array A is an integer within the range `[−1,000..1,000]`.
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.

Solution: [CyclicRotation.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/CyclicRotation.java)

## OddOccurrencesInArray

A non-empty array `A` consisting of `N` integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

For example, in array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
    A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
    A[6] = 9

* the elements at indexes `0` and `2` have value `9`,
* the elements at indexes `1` and `3` have value `3`,
* the elements at indexes `4` and `6` have value `9`,
* the element at index `5` has value `7` and is unpaired.

Write a function:

```
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```

that, given an array `A` consisting of `N` integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9
    A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7
    A[6] = 9
the function should return `7`, as explained in the example above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` is an odd integer within the range `[1..1,000,000]`;
* each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[1..1,000,000,000]`;
* all but one of the values in `A` occur an even number of times.

Solution: [OddOccurrencesInArray.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/OddOccurrencesInArray.java)

## FrogJmp

A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position `X` and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to `Y`. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, `D`.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

Write a function:

```
class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }
```

that, given three integers `X`, `Y` and `D`, returns the minimal number of jumps from position `X` to a position equal to or greater than `Y`.

For example, given:

    X = 10
    Y = 85
    D = 30

the function should return `3`, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

* after the first jump, at position `10 + 30 = 40`
* after the second jump, at position `10 + 30 + 30 = 70`
* after the third jump, at position `10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100`

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `X`, `Y` and `D` are integers within the range `[1..1,000,000,000]`;
* `X ≤ Y`.

Solution: [FrogJmp.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/FrogJmp.java)

## PermMissingElem

An array `A` consisting of `N` different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range `[1..(N + 1)]`, which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

```
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```

that, given an array `A`, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 2
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 1
    A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` is an integer within the range `[0..100,000]`;
* the elements of `A` are all distinct;
* each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[1..(N + 1)]`.

Solution: [PermMissingElem.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/PermMissingElem.java)

## TapeEquilibrium

A non-empty array `A` consisting of `N` integers is given. Array `A` represents numbers on a tape.

Any integer `P`, such that 0 < P < N, splits this tape into two non-empty parts: `A[0], A[1], ..., A[P − 1]` and `A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[N − 1]`.

The difference between the two parts is the value of: `|(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P − 1]) − (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[N − 1])|`

In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.

For example, consider array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 3
We can split this tape in four places:

    P = 1, difference = |3 − 10| = 7
    P = 2, difference = |4 − 9| = 5
    P = 3, difference = |6 − 7| = 1
    P = 4, difference = |10 − 3| = 7
Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```
that, given a non-empty array `A` of `N` integers, returns the minimal difference that can be achieved.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 3
the function should return 1, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` is an integer within the range `[2..100,000]`;
* each element of array A is an integer within the range `[−1,000..1,000]`.

Solution: [TapeEquilibrium.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/TapeEquilibrium.java)

## FrogRiverOne

A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially located on one bank of the river (position `0`) and wants to get to the opposite bank (position `X+1`). Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.

You are given an array `A` consisting of `N` integers representing the falling leaves. `A[K]` represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.

The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from `1` to `X` (that is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions from `1` to `X` are covered by leaves). You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.

For example, you are given integer `X = 5` and array A such that:

    A[0] = 1
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 1
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 2
    A[5] = 3
    A[6] = 5
    A[7] = 4
In second `6`, a leaf falls into position `5`. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.

Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int solution(int X, int[] A); }
```
that, given a non-empty array `A` consisting of N integers and integer `X`, returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.

If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return `−1`.

For example, given `X = 5` and array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 1
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 1
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 2
    A[5] = 3
    A[6] = 5
    A[7] = 4
the function should return `6`, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` and `X` are integers within the range `[1..100,000]`;
* each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[1..X]`.

Solution: [FrogRiverOne.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/FrogRiverOne.java)

## PermCheck

A non-empty array `A` consisting of `N` integers is given.

A permutation is a sequence containing each element from `1` to `N` once, and only once.

For example, array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
is a permutation, but array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
is not a permutation, because value `2` is missing.

The goal is to check whether array `A` is a permutation.

Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```
that, given an array `A`, returns `1` if array `A` is a permutation and `0` if it is not.

For example, given array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
the function should return `1`.

Given array `A` such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
the function should return `0`.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` is an integer within the range `[1..100,000]`;
* each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[1..1,000,000,000]`.

Solution: [PermCheck.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/PermCheck.java)

## MaxCounters

You are given `N` counters, initially set to `0`, and you have two possible operations on them:

* _increase(X)_ − counter `X` is increased by `1`,
* _max counter_ − all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.
A non-empty array `A` of `M` integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:

* if `A[K] = X`, such that `1 ≤ X ≤ N`, then operation `K` is `increase(X)`,
* if `A[K] = N + 1` then operation `K` is max counter.
For example, given integer `N = 5` and array `A` such that:
  ```
    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4
  ```
the values of the counters after each consecutive operation will be:

    (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 2, 0)
    (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 3, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 4, 2)
The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.

Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int[] solution(int N, int[] A); }
```
that, given an integer `N` and a non-empty array `A` consisting of M integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4
the function should return `[3, 2, 2, 4, 2]`, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` and `M` are integers within the range `[1..100,000]`;
* each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[1..N + 1]`.

Solution: [MaxCounters.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/MaxCounters.java)

## MissingInteger

Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```
that, given an array `A` of `N` integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in `A`.

For example, given `A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]`, the function should return `5`.

Given `A = [1, 2, 3]`, the function should return `4`.

Given `A = [−1, −3]`, the function should return `1`.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` is an integer within the range `[1..100,000]`;
* each element of array `A` is an integer within the range `[−1,000,000..1,000,000]`.

Solution: [MissingInteger.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/MissingInteger.java)

## PassingCars

A non-empty array `A` consisting of `N` integers is given. The consecutive elements of array `A` represent consecutive cars on a road.

Array `A` contains only 0s and/or 1s:

* `0` represents a car traveling east,
* `1` represents a car traveling west.
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars `(P, Q)`, where `0 ≤ P < Q < N`, is passing when `P` is traveling to the east and `Q` is traveling to the west.

For example, consider array A such that:
```
  A[0] = 0
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 1
```
We have five pairs of passing cars: `(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)`.

Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
```
that, given a non-empty array `A` of `N` integers, returns the number of pairs of passing cars.

The function should return `−1` if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds `1,000,000,000`.

For example, given:
```
  A[0] = 0
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 1
```
the function should return `5`, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `N` is an integer within the range `[1..100,000]`;
* each element of array `A` is an integer that can have one of the following values: `0, 1`.

Solution: [PassingCars.java](src/main/java/dev/thiagooliveira/codilitytraining/PassingCars.java)

## CountDiv

Write a function:
```
class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B, int K); }
```
that, given three integers `A, B and K`, returns the number of integers within the range `[A..B]` that are divisible by `K`, i.e.:
```
{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }
```
For example, for `A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2`, your function should return `3`, because there are three numbers divisible by `2` within the range `[6..11]`, namely `6, 8 and 10`.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* `A` and `B` are integers within the range `[0..2,000,000,000]`;
* `K` is an integer within the range `[1..2,000,000,000]`;
* `A ≤ B`.
